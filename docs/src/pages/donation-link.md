A Donation Link is the simplist way for charties to recieve digital donations outside of their websites with **no-code**. Donors either click on short links (e.g evr.fund/demo) online or scan QR codes in-person on print media to access a fast an easy way to make a donation no matter where a charity engages with their supporter.

```bash
https://evr.fund/demo
```

## Options

**Query Paramerters**

- `redirect_on_success: string`
  - passing a URL on redirect on success means that when the payment completes it will automatically redirect to whatever link provided so you can create a custom thank you page
- `embed_origin: string`
  - this parameter is normally the page that they came from so if they share the donation page on social media it will have a link to share the previous page that they were previously on
